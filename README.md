# Matching Engine

A high-performance, real-time matching engine implemented in C++ supporting market and limit orders with FIFO price-time priority matching algorithms.

## 🚀 Current Status: Core Engine Complete ✅

### ✅ **Completed Components**

**Core Data Structures**
- **`types.hpp`** - Complete type system with strong aliases, enums, validation constants
- **`order.hpp/cpp`** - Full Order class with matching logic, FIFO priority, partial fills
- **`order_book.hpp/cpp`** - Complete OrderBook with all matching algorithms implemented

**Key Features Working**
- ✅ **FIFO Price-Time Priority**: Proper order queue management within price levels
- ✅ **Market & Limit Orders**: Full support for both order types with immediate execution
- ✅ **Real-Time Matching**: `executeMarketOrder()` and `matchLimitOrder()` algorithms
- ✅ **Order Management**: Add, cancel, and modify orders with O(1) lookup
- ✅ **Trade Generation**: Complete trade execution with proper price priority rules
- ✅ **Market Data**: Best bid/ask, spread calculation, order book depth

### 🎯 **Next Steps**
1. **Networking Layer** - Boost.asio client-server architecture
2. **Testing Suite** - Comprehensive unit and integration tests  
3. **Performance Optimization** - Profiling and latency improvements
4. **Risk Management** - Position limits and circuit breakers

**Data Structures**: Maps with custom comparators for price-time priority, hash maps for O(1) order lookup, FIFO queues within price levels.
