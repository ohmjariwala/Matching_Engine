# Matching Engine

## Project Goal

This project aims to build a high-performance, real-time matching engine system implemented in C++ that facilitates efficient order matching for financial markets. The system will include both client and server components with networking capabilities, supporting market and limit orders with FIFO price-time priority matching algorithms.

## Progress Completed

### âœ… Core Data Structures & Types (100% Complete)

**File: `include/matching_engine/types.hpp`**
- Defined comprehensive type system with strong type aliases (`OrderId`, `Price`, `Quantity`, `TradeId`)
- Implemented scoped enumerations for type safety:
  - `OrderSide`: BUY/SELL with memory-efficient `uint8_t` backing
  - `OrderType`: MARKET/LIMIT orders
  - `OrderStatus`: Complete order lifecycle tracking (PENDING â†’ ACTIVE â†’ FILLED/CANCELLED)
  - `TradeSide`: Trade perspective tracking
- Added validation constants and utility functions:
  - Price and quantity validation ranges
  - String conversion utilities for debugging
  - Helper functions like `getOppositeSide()` for matching logic

**File: `include/matching_engine/order.hpp`**
- Fully implemented `Order` class with comprehensive functionality:
  - **Constructor Support**: Both limit orders (with price) and market orders (price = 0)
  - **State Management**: Tracks original quantity, remaining quantity, and fill status
  - **FIFO Support**: High-resolution timestamps for price-time priority
  - **Matching Logic**: `canMatchWith()` method with proper buy/sell price validation
  - **Priority Ordering**: `hasHigherPriorityThan()` implementing price-time priority
  - **Utility Methods**: Complete set of boolean checks (isMarketOrder, isBuyOrder, etc.)
  - **Partial Fills**: `fill()` method with validation and error handling

### ðŸ”§ Key Features Implemented

1. **Price-Time Priority Algorithm**: Orders are prioritized by best price first, then by timestamp (FIFO)
2. **Market vs Limit Order Support**: Market orders execute immediately; limit orders wait for price conditions
3. **Proper Order Matching**: Buy orders match sell orders when `buy_price >= sell_price`
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Using appropriate data types (uint8_t for enums, uint64_t for IDs)
5. **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents common errors and improves code clarity
6. **Exception Safety**: Proper error handling with `std::invalid_argument` for invalid operations
7. **Documentation**: Comprehensive Doxygen-style documentation for all public APIs

## Next Steps

### ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Next Phase: Order Book Implementation
- Implement queue-based order book data structure
- Add/remove orders with proper priority queues
- Handle market order execution against existing limit orders
- Implement order cancellation

### ðŸš€ Future Development Phases
1. **Core Matching Engine**: Central engine coordinating order book operations
2. **Trade Generation**: Create trade records when orders match
3. **Networking Layer**: Boost.asio-based client/server architecture
4. **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
5. **Performance Optimization**: Latency and throughput improvements
6. **Example Applications**: Demo clients and usage scenarios

## Technical Considerations Addressed

- **FIFO Compliance**: Proper timestamp-based ordering within price levels
- **Market Order Handling**: Immediate execution at best available prices
- **Partial Fill Support**: Orders can be partially filled over multiple matches
- **Type Safety**: Prevent common trading system bugs through strong typing
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized for high-frequency trading scenarios
- **Error Handling**: Robust validation and exception management

## Build Requirements

- C++17 or later
- CMake 3.16+
- Boost.asio (for networking components)
- Catch2 (for testing framework)
